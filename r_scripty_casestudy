##loading in data that I think might be useful.
daily_activity = read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_calories = read.csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
daily_steps = read.csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
sleep_info = read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")

##Getting an idea of how data is stored and if there are any discrepancies.

head(daily_activity)
head(daily_calories)
head(sleep_info)
head(daily_steps)

##Date/Time is formatted differently in each data set.
sleep_info = separate(sleep_info,SleepDay,c("Date","Time","AM/PM"), sep = " ")
daily_calories = rename(daily_calories, Date = ActivityDay)
daily_activity = rename(daily_activity, Date = ActivityDate)
daily_steps = rename(daily_steps, Date = ActivityDay)
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(daily_calories)
colnames(sleep_info)
colnames(daily_steps)

##plotting data to see any trends in Daily Wear
ggplot(data = daily_activity)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Date,y=Calories))+
  facet_wrap(~Id)+
  theme(
    axis.title.y=element_text(size=18), 
    axis.title.x=element_text(size=18),
    axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, size=10)
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE))
#can see that wear is pretty steady, there are certain users that did not log steps/calories for entirety of study

ggplot(data = daily_steps)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Date,y=StepTotal))+
  facet_wrap(~Id)+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE))

#merging daily_steps and daily_calories for easier statistical analysis.
merged_steps_calories = full_join(daily_steps,daily_calories)

plot1 = ggplot(data = merged_steps_calories)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Date,y=Calories), size = .1)+
  facet_wrap(~Id)+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE))

plot2 = ggplot(data = Merged_steps_calories)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Date, y=StepTotal), size = .1)+
  facet_wrap(~Id)+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE))

plot1 + plot2

## Now going to plot StepTotal vs Calories

ggplot(data = Merged_steps_calories)+
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = StepTotal, y = Calories, color = Id))
  
## Can also determine if statistical significance between steptotal and calories

cor(Merged_steps_calories$StepTotal,Merged_steps_calories$Calories)


##Can see there is a correlation between Calories and StepTotal, need to get rid of outliers.
##Using summarize to find outliers in data

Merged_steps_calories%>%
  select(StepTotal,Calories)%>%
  summary()

##We can see major outliers in StepTotal that might be skewing results, and can also see results for zero, which means they did not record or did not use smartwear.

#correcting for major outliers

corrected_data = subset(Merged_steps_calories, StepTotal < 30000 & StepTotal > 0 & Calories > 0)

corrected_data%>%
  select(StepTotal,Calories)%>%
  summary()

ggplot(data = corrected_data)+
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = StepTotal, y = Calories, color = Id))
